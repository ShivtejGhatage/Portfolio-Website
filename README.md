# Portfolio Website

To run the code open index.html

The website has an About page (accessible by clicking the logo/signature), a Hobbies page with 3 sections (accesible by clicking the images), an Education page and a Contact page.

Note that the 3 hobby pages are opened by clicking on the images.

The website is made only using HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are animations on hovering images and buttons made using css and the site is made responsive using media queries.

The contact page uses javascript and the href mail to attribute to open a window to send messages directly to my email id. (This only works if email service is active on the device).

The site works on all screen sizes (mobile and web).
